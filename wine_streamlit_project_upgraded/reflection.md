# Short Reflection

**What improved after tuning**
- Cross-validated accuracy increased and variance across folds reduced.
- Final test accuracy and F1 improved compared to baseline Random Forest.

**Challenges faced**
- Selecting a grid that balances search space and compute time.
- Ensuring numeric-only features for the Streamlit sliders.

**Key insights**
- Even a small grid can yield meaningful improvements.
- Stratified K-Fold is important when class imbalance exists.
