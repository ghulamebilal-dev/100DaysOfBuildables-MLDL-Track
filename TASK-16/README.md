# Random Forest + K-Fold CV + Hyperparameter Tuning on UCI Wine Dataset

## Contents
- `wine_rf_cv_tuning.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook with full code, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, and markdown reflection.
- `wine_dataset.csv` : The dataset (UCI Wine) used for the project (saved from sklearn).
- `requirements.txt` : Suggested Python packages.

## Dataset Source
- UCI Machine Learning Repository â€” Wine dataset. (Loaded via `sklearn.datasets.load_wine`)

## Summary
This project trains a Random Forest classifier on the Wine dataset, evaluates performance using K-Fold cross-validation, performs GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning, and compares pre- and post-tuning performance metrics. See the notebook for full code and results.
